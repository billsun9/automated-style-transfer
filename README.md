# automated-style-transfer

This web application provides a means of automatically transferring the artistic style of various famous pieces of artwork to an arbitrary user image. It was built using Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The neural transfer model utlized in the web app was based on the model code in magenta (https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization) and the publication:

Libraries used include Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
